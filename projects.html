    <p class="p" style = "font-family: verdana">This is my final performance task for my APCSP class. It's a quiz that determines whether a person is healthy or not based on their answers to the health-related questions. It took a couple of days for me to pick a topic for this project and several weeks of writing the code.  </p>
